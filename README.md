# Marovi API

**The open source engine powering [https://marovi.ai](https://marovi.ai)**

Marovi API is a modular, enterprise-ready platform that unifies access to AI services like LLMs and translation across providers such as OpenAI, Google, DeepL, and Anthropic. It offers a single, streamlined API layer for managing these services and defining custom endpoints.

This is the same infrastructure used by Marovi.ai to:
- Translate and summarize AI research papers
- Build a multilingual, LLM-enhanced wiki for research comprehension
- Benchmark translation providers

## What It Offers

- Unified API for multiple LLM and translation services
- Customizable, prompt-driven endpoints for structured tasks
- Designed for both synchronous and asynchronous usage
- Batch processing and caching support
- Extensible architecture that supports custom providers and endpoints

## Use Cases

- Centralizing access to all your AI services through one API
- Deploying a multilingual content workflow (like Marovi Wiki)
- Creating custom AI-powered endpoints for repetitive or structured tasks
- Offering hosted or on-prem enterprise-grade open source deployments

## Open Source Commitment

Marovi API is fully open source. Our goal is to make AI infrastructure transparent, extensible, and easy to adoptâ€”whether hosted by us or deployed independently. Enterprises can rely on the same tools we use, with full visibility and no lock-in.

We welcome contributions and are actively growing the ecosystem.
